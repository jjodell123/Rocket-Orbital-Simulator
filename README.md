# Rocket-Orbital-Simulator
This educational simulation allows the user to observe rocket trajectories and then calculate and observe their own. There is a
work sheet that goes with it to make the program more understandable.

The project was created for my senior thesis at Academic Magnet High School and has been tested to successfully teach students basic
concepts in orbital mechanics, assuming a priod knowledge of basic physics.
